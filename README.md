# qclab
qclab (pronounced "qc" "lab") is a package for carrying out mixed quantum-classical (MQC) dynamics simulations. It implements popular MQC algorithms in a manner that is agnostic to the underlying physical system and flexible to the mixed quantum-classical algorithm. Along with its dynamics algorithms, qclab comes equipped with a variety of physical models that can be used as starting points for exploring MQC dynamics or to implement more elaborate models. Check out the documentation at ____ to learn more about implementing new models.
