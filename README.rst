QC Lab: A package for quantum-classical modeling
================================================


**QC Lab** is a Python package designed for implementing and executing quantum-classical (QC) dynamics simulations.
It offers an environment for developing physical models and QC algorithms which enables algorithms and models to be combined arbitrarily.
QC Lab comes with a variety of already implemented models and algorithms which we hope encourage new researchers to explore the field of q
uantum-classical dynamics. Users that implement their own models and algorithms will have the opportunity to contribute them to QC Lab to form a 
growing library of quantum-classical dynamics tools.


**QC Lab** is developed and maintained by the Tempelaar Team in the Chemistry Department of Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, USA.


The documentation for QC Lab can be found at https://tempelaar-team.github.io/qc_lab/.


Capabilities
