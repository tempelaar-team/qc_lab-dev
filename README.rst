QC Lab: A package for quantum-classical modeling
================================================


**QC Lab** is a Python package designed for implementing and executing quantum-classical (QC) dynamics simulations.
It offers an environment for developing physical models and QC algorithms which enables algorithms and models to be combined arbitrarily.
QC Lab comes with a variety of already implemented models and algorithms which we hope will encourage new researchers to explore the field of quantum-classical dynamics. Users that implement their own models and algorithms will have the opportunity to contribute them to QC Lab to form a growing library of quantum-classical dynamics tools.


**QC Lab** is developed and maintained by the Tempelaar Team in the Chemistry Department of Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, USA.


The documentation for QC Lab can be found at https://tempelaar-team.github.io/qclab/.


Capabilities
------------

Dynamics Algorithms
```````````````````

The following algorithms are implemented making use of the complex-classical coordinate formalism established in [1].


* Mean-field (Ehrenfest) dynamics [2]
* Fewest-switches surface hopping (FSSH) dynamics [3]

Model Systems
`````````````

* Spin-boson model [4]
* Holstein lattice model [5]
* Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex [6, 7]
* Tully problems I, II, & III [8]


Installing QC Lab
-----------------

QC Lab can be installed from the Python Package Index (PyPI) by executing::

   pip install qclab

To install QC Lab without h5py or numba support, execute::

   pip install qclab --no-deps
   pip install numpy tqdm

to install the remaining required dependencies manually.

QC Lab can be installed from source by downloading the `latest release <https://github.com/tempelaar-team/qclab/releases>`_,
unpacking it, and executing::

   pip install ./

from inside its topmost directory (where the `pyproject.toml` file is located).


QC Lab doesn’t enforce third-party dependencies. If you hit resolver conflicts or install errors, the quickest fix is to install in a clean Python environment (via `venv` or `conda`). Alternatively, reconcile package versions in your existing environment until the requirements are satisfied.
