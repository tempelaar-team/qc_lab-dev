Default Behavior
================


Default Simulation Settings
---------------------------

By default QC Lab uses the following settings in the simulation object. These settings can be adjusted by changing the values in the `sim` object.

.. code-block:: python

    sim = Simulation()
    sim.settings.var = val # Can change the value of a setting like this

    # or by passing the setting directly to the simulation object.
    sim = Simulation({'var': val})

   * - Variable
     - Description
     - Default Value
   * - `num_trajs`
     - The total number of trajectories to run.
     - 10
   * - `batch_size`
     - The (maximum) number of trajectories to run simultaneously.
     - 1
   * - `tmax`
     - The total time of each trajectory.
     - 10
   * - `dt`
     - The timestep used for executing the update recipe (the dynamics propagation).
     - 0.01
   * - `dt_output`
     - The timestep used for executing the output recipe (the calculation of observables).
     - 0.1

.. note::

    QC Lab expects that the total time of the simulation is an integer multiple of the output timestep `dt_output`, which must also be an integer multiple 
    of the propagation timestep `dt`.

 
Default Model Attributes
------------------------

For minimal models where only the Hamiltonian of the system is defined in the Model class, QC Lab employs numerical methods to carry out 
particular steps in the dynamics algorithms. This page describes those default actions and also the constants that can be used to manipulate them. 
Because they are formally treated as model ingredients they  have the same ingredient format discussed in the model development guide. 

All of the constants below can be set by adjusting their value in the `model.constants` object, for example:

.. code-block:: python

    sim.model.constants.default_value = # fix the value of the constant 'default_value'


Initialization of classical coordinates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


.. function:: sim.model.init_classical(model, constants, parameters, seed=seed)

    :param seed: List of seeds used to initialize random numbers. 
    :type seed: np.ndarray((batch_size), dtype=int)
    :returns: Initial complex-valued classical coordinate. 
    :rtype: np.ndarray((batch_size, sim.model.constants.num_classical_coordinates), dtype=complex)

By default, QC Lab uses a Markov-chain Monte Carlo implementation of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to sample a Boltzmann distribution corresponding to 
`sim.model.h_c` at the thermal quantum `sim.model.constants.kBT`. We encourage caution and further validation before using it on arbitrary classical 
potentials as fine-tuning of the algorithm parameters may be required to obtain reliable results.

The implementation utilizes a single random walker in `sim.model.constants.num_classical_coordinates` dimensions or `sim.model.constants.num_classical_coordinates` 
walkers each in one dimension (depending on if `mcmc_h_c_separable==True`) and evolves the walkers from the initial point `mcmc_init_z` by sampling a Gaussian distribution with
a standard deviation `mcmc_std` for `mcmc_burn_in_size` steps. It then evolves the walkers another `mcmc_sample_size` steps to collect a distribution of initial coordinates from which 
the required number of initial conditions are drawn uniformly. At a minimum, one should ensure that `mcmc_sample_size` is large enough to ensure a full exploration of the phase-space.

   * - `mcmc_h_c_separable`

   * - `mcmc_init_z`
     - The initial coordinate that the random walker is initialized at. 
     - A point in the interval (0,1) for both real and imaginary parts in each coordinate. (This is deterministically chosen for reproducability).

    :rtype: Tuple


QC Lab utilizes a finite difference method to calculate the gradient of the quantum-classical Hamiltonian. Unlike that of the 
classical Hamiltonian, however, the output is in a sparse format.

Surface Hopping Switching Algorithm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. function:: sim.model.hop_function(model, constants, parameters, z=z, delta_z=delta_z, ev_diff=ev_diff)

    :param z: Complex-valued classical coordinate (in a single trajectory).
    :type z: np.ndarray(sim.model.constants.num_classical_coordinates, dtype=complex)
    :param delta_z: Rescaling direction.
    :type delta_z: np.ndarray(sim.model.constants.num_classical_coordinates, dtype=complex)
    :param ev_diff: Energy difference between final and initial surface (final - initial).
    :type ev_diff: float
    :returns: Rescaled coordinate.
    :rtype: np.ndarray(sim.model.constants.num_classical_coordinates, dtype=complex)
    :returns: True or False depending on if a hop happened.
    :rtype: Bool.

QC Lab implements a numerical method to find the scalar factor (gamma) required to rescale classical coordinates in the surface hopping algorithm. It works by constructing a uniform grid with 
`numerical_fssh_hop_num_points` points 
from negative to positive and determines the point at which energy is conserved the closest. It then recenters the 
grid at that point and reduces the range by 0.5 and once again searches for the point at which energy is conserved the closest. It repeats that step for `numerical_fssh_hop_max_iter`
iterations or until the energy difference is less than `numerical_fssh_hop_threshold`. If the energy it reaches is less than the threshold then the hop is 
accepted, if it is greater then the hop is rejected.
