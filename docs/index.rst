QC Lab: A package for quantum-classical modeling
================================================


**QC Lab** is a Python package designed for implementing and executing quantum-classical (QC) dynamics simulations. It offers a framework for developing both physical models 
and QC algorithms that enables algorithms and models to be combined arbitrarily. QC Lab comes with a variety of already implemented models and algorithms which we hope 
encourage new researchers to explore the field of quantum-classical dynamics. It also provides a framework for advanced users to implement their own models and algorithms 
which we hope will become part of a growing library of quantum-classical dynamics tools.
