Tasks in QC Lab
=================

In QC Lab, algorithms essentially consist of lists of functions, called **tasks**, that are executed in a specific order.
These tasks are the building blocks of the algorithm and define how different quantities are manipulated to evolve the quantum-classical system.
Tasks have a very well-defined structure, which allows them to be easily defined and executed, as well as to be reused across different algorithms.
