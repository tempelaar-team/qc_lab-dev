Installing QC Lab
====================

This guide walks you through installing QC Lab from source or from PyPI, using pip.

Requirements
------------
- Python 3.8 or newer
- pip (Python package installer)
- git (optional, for cloning the repository directly)


Installing from PyPI
--------------------
QC Lab can be installed from the Python Package Index (PyPI) by executing


.. code-block:: bash

      pip install qclab


To install QC Lab without h5py or numba support, execute

.. code-block:: bash

      pip install qclab --no-deps
      pip install numpy tqdm

to install the remaining required dependencies manually.


Installing from source
----------------------

You can install QC Lab from source by downloading the repository and executing


.. code-block:: bash

      pip install ./

from inside its topmost directory (where the `pyproject.toml` file is located).

.. note::

      QC Lab does not enforce compatibility between the versions of its dependencies.
      If you run into issues installing it we suggest creating a fresh Python environment using `venv` or `conda`
      and installing QC Lab there, or ensuring compatibility of the dependencies manually.


Thatâ€™s it! QC Lab should now be installed and ready for use.
