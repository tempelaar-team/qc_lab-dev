Tasks
==========================

Tasks are functions that carry out the elementary operations of an algorithm by modifying a
``state`` object and optionally a ``parameters`` object, which are instances of the ``qclab.Variable`` class (see :ref:`Variable Objects <variable_objects>`).
Built-in tasks can be found in the ``qclab.tasks`` module and are documented on this page.

A generic tasks has the form:

.. code-block:: python

    def my_task(sim, state, parameters, **kwargs):
        # Get any keyword arguments, with default values if not provided.
        kwarg1 = kwargs.get('kwarg1', default_value1)
        # Carry out the task by modifying state and parameters
        return state, parameters

where ``sim`` is an instance of the ``qclab.Simulation`` class (see :ref:`Simulations <simulation>`), and ``**kwargs`` are any additional keyword arguments that customize the task to the context in which it is used. Generally, keyword arguments specify
which attributes of the ``state`` and ``parameters`` objects are to be used and/or modified by the task (e.g., the name of the wavefunction or Hamiltonian attributes). 


If a task has keyword arguments, they must be provided when the task is included in the algorithm's recipe (see :ref:`Algorithms <algorithm>`) by using the ``partial`` function from the ``functools`` module, as in:

.. code-block:: python

    from functools import partial
    # Specifying keyword arguments when including a task in a recipe.
    algorithm.initialization_recipe = [partial(my_task, kwarg1=value1), ...]
    # Including a task without keyword arguments.
    algorithm.initialization_recipe = [another_task, ...]


Vectorization
--------------------------

In QC Lab, attributes of the ``state`` and ``parameters`` objects are vectorized by default, meaning that they have an additional leading dimension that indexes multiple trajectories.
For example, the diabatic wavefunction attribute ``wf_db`` of the ``state`` object has shape ``(sim.settings.batch_size, sim.model.constants.num_quantum_states)``, where ``sim.settings.batch_size`` is the number of trajectories in the batch and ``sim.model.constants.num_quantum_states`` is the number of quantum states in the model.


Initialization, Update, and Collect Tasks
------------------------------------------------

Tasks are organized into three categories: initialization tasks, update tasks, and collect tasks.
Initialization tasks create objects in the ``state`` and ``parameters`` objects that are needed for the simulation, update tasks propagate the attributes of the ``state`` and ``parameters`` objects forward in time, and collect tasks gather and process the results of the simulation into the output dictionary.

Examples of these tasks are:

.. code-block:: python

    def my_initialization_task(sim, state, parameters, **kwargs):
        # Create an attribute in the state object.
        shape = (sim.settings.num_trajs, sim.model.constants.num_quantum_states)
        state.new_attribute = np.zeros(shape, dtype=complex)
        return state, parameters

    def my_update_task(sim, state, parameters, **kwargs):
        # Update an attribute in the state object.
        state.new_attribute += 1j
        return state, parameters

    def my_collect_task(sim, state, parameters, **kwargs):
        # Collect results into the output dictionary.
        state.output_dict['new_attribute'] = state.new_attribute
        return state, parameters

These tasks can then be included in the appropriate recipe of an algorithm object (see :ref:`Algorithms <algorithm>`). Notice that none of these tasks have keyword arguments and so can be included directly in recipes without using ``partial``.

Built-in Tasks
--------------------------
Built-in tasks can be found in the ``qclab.tasks`` module and are documented below.

.. note::

   All tasks assume that the model object has a minimal set of constants including ``num_quantum_states`` (the number of quantum states) and ``num_classical_coordinates`` (the number of classical coordinates), ``classical_coordinate_mass`` (the mass of the classical coordinates), and ``classical_coordinate_weight`` (the weight of the classical coordinates). These constants are discussed in :ref:`Models <model>`. For brevity we exclude explicit mention of these constants in the task documentation.
